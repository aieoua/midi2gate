# midi2gate
This project contains firmware and schematics for MIDI to GATE converter based on ATMEGA328p.

This is a DIY project, suitable for beginners, although a general knowledge of electronics, basic tools and skills are required to build this converter. The schematics presented here feature:

- midi input
- 6 programmable buffered gate outputs

The main feature of the project is the support of midi polyphony, which means that all outputs can send a signal at once. Another feature is that you can assign any midi notes to the individual outputs using two buttons and thus not limit yourself to a predetermined range of notes.

## Usage
My original intention was to send a signal to the drum module in my modular synth, which only has analog inputs. But the possibilities are endless.
